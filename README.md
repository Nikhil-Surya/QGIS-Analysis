## 🔍 Key Insights
**🌊 Coastal Vulnerability:**
Coastal areas, especially along the Ring of Fire, experience frequent and intense seismic activity. \
**🏙️ Population Density & Earthquakes:**
Inverse Relationship: High population density areas tend to experience fewer earthquakes, though the impact is often severe when they occur. \
**🗂️ Categorization & Data Layers:**
Earthquake-prone regions classified into low, medium, and high-risk zones. 
Additional data layers (e.g., roads, waterbodies) integrated to assess infrastructure risks.
## 📊 Methodology
**Data Collection:** Earthquake activity data from the past 30 days.\
**GIS Processing:** Analyzed spatial and temporal patterns using QGIS. \
**Visualization:** Created layered maps to highlight seismic risks and population density correlations.
